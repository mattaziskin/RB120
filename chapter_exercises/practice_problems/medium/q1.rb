Ben asked Alyssa to code review the following code:

class BankAccount
  attr_reader :balance

  def initialize(starting_balance)
    @balance = starting_balance
  end

  def positive_balance?
    balance >= 0
  end
end

Alyssa glanced over the code quickly and said - "It looks fine, except that you
forgot to put the @ before balance when you refer to the balance instance
variable in the body of the positive_balance? method."

"Not so fast", Ben replied. "What I'm doing here is valid - I'm not missing an @!"

Who is right, Ben or Alyssa, and why?

Either way would work, the way it's written it actually calls the balance reader
method since we input :balance in our attr_reader section

class BankAccount
  attr_reader :balance

  def initialize(starting_balance)
    @balance = starting_balance
  end

  def positive_balance?
    balance >= 0
  end
end

me = BankAccount.new(100)
p me.positive_balance?
